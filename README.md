🚨 Emergency Vehicle Classification with CNN

📌 Project Overview
This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify images of emergency and non-emergency vehicles. A series of CNN models were trained on a labeled image dataset to distinguish between classes (0 = non-emergency, 1 = emergency). The models were evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.

🔍 Best Performing Model:
Model 6 achieved the highest overall performance with an accuracy of 80%, showing improved balance in detecting both emergency and non-emergency vehicles after applying batch normalization and reducing fully connected layers.
